# End-to-End ML & Deep Learning Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning and deep learning pipeline using Python. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and performance comparison using both traditional ML and neural networks.

##  Project Overview

-  **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling and normalization
-  **Feature Engineering**: Correlation analysis, SelectKBest, Random Forest importance
-  **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA to retain 95% of data variance
-  **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest classifier with multiple feature sets
-  **Deep Learning**: Neural network (MLP) built with Keras for binary classification
-  **Clustering & Outliers**: DBSCAN used to detect clusters and isolate anomalies
-  **Model Comparison**: Evaluated using accuracy and training time with visual plots
