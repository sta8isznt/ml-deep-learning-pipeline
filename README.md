## 🚀 Project Overview

- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling and normalization
- 🧠 **Feature Engineering**: Correlation analysis, SelectKBest, Random Forest importance
- 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA to retain 95% of data variance
- 🌲 **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest classifier with multiple feature sets
- 🤖 **Deep Learning**: Neural network (MLP) built with Keras for binary classification
- 🔍 **Clustering & Outliers**: DBSCAN used to detect clusters and isolate anomalies
- 📈 **Model Comparison**: Evaluated using accuracy and training time with visual plots
